I built a Python project that can provide suggestions based on user input.
The project utilizes textdistance library for measuring similarity between words, pandas for data manipulation, and Flask for creating a web interface.
By leveraging techniques like Jaccard similarity and probabilistic models, I tried to create an efficient and accurate auto suggestion system.
